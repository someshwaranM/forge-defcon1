Loads data/real_cms_lcd_policies.json into the medical-policies index.

WHERE THIS DATA CAME FROM: the user downloaded CMS's own "current LCD"
bulk database export directly from the Medicare Coverage Database
(cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database -> Downloadable Databases) -- a zip
containing the full national LCD table (lcd.csv, ~220k LCD revision rows)
plus contractor/jurisdiction cross-reference tables. This sidesteps the
Akamai bot-protection that blocked automated fetches from cms.gov
directly (see ingest_policies.py's docstring) -- a human downloading the
file through their own browser has no such restriction.

app/ingestion/extract_real_cms_lcds.py (this pair script) then:
  - found LCD L36575 "Total Knee Arthroplasty" (CPT 27447, matches
    CLM-1001/CLM-2001) and LCD L34163 "Total Hip Arthroplasty" (CPT
    27130), both status=A (currently active)
  - stripped the embedded HTML from CMS's own `indication` field
  - split that field on its own real "Limitations" heading into
    clinical_indications / contraindications (mirrors what
    ingest_policies.py does for a PDF, but here the source is already
    structured CSV, not heuristic PDF text extraction)
  - resolved the adopting Medicare Administrative Contractor's real
    name via the contractor cross-reference tables (Noridian Healthcare
    Solutions, LLC, for both)
  - deliberately left icd10_codes blank: this CSV table does not carry
    ICD-10 codes (CMS ships those in a separate "billing and coding
    article" export this download didn't include) -- left empty rather
    than guessed

Each doc's `_source_note` (stripped before indexing, same convention as
ingest_synthea_samples.py) documents the exact LCD ID, revision date,
and adopting contractor for anyone who wants to check it against the
source themselves.

FINDING WORTH KNOWING FOR THE DEMO: unlike the hand-authored sample
policy (POL-UHC-KNEE-01, which specifies "6 months of physical
therapy"), the real Medicare LCD does NOT specify a fixed therapy
duration -- it says "history of unsuccessful conservative therapy...
clearly addressed in the pre-procedure medical record" without a month
count. So step_therapy_required computed out to False for both real
LCDs. That's accurate to the real policy, not a bug -- Medicare's
national LCD is less prescriptive than commercial payer policy on this
point, and the demo narrative should say so if it uses these documents.
