"""
Elasticsearch client singleton.

Supports three connection shapes:
  1. Classic Elastic Cloud (hosted deployments): cloud_id + api_key.
  2. Elastic Cloud Serverless: url (the project's https://...es....elastic.cloud
     endpoint) + api_key. Serverless projects don't expose a classic
     base64 Cloud ID and don't support basic auth — API key over the
     endpoint URL is the only supported auth method.
  3. Self-managed / local Docker cluster: url + basic auth
     (username/password), or url with no auth at all for a local dev
     cluster running with security disabled.

BUILT LIVE (18 Sept) — fixed after discovering during local setup that a
Serverless project's "connection details" panel gives you a URL endpoint,
not a Cloud ID, and the original url-only branch only supported basic
auth, which Serverless rejects. Put the project's endpoint URL in
ELASTIC_URL and its API key in ELASTIC_API_KEY (leave ELASTIC_CLOUD_ID
blank) to connect to Serverless with this client.
